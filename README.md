# Advanced House Price Regression

This repository contains my solution to the [Advanced House Price Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on Kaggle. The goal is to predict house prices using various regression techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Rank Achieved:** 184 out of 5,000+ participants
- **Kaggle Score:** 0.119

## Approach

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Extensive analysis to understand data distribution, correlations, and outliers.
- Visualization of key features to gain insights into price determinants.

### Feature Engineering

- Imputed missing values and transformed skewed features.
- Created new features based on data descriptions.

### Models Tried

- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **CatBoost Regressor**

### Ensemble Method

- Implemented a Voting Regressor combining the best-performing models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to enhance predictive modeling in the housing market. By understanding the data through EDA and creating meaningful features, we improved the model's performance. The combination of various regression techniques and ensemble methods, like the Voting Regressor, resulted in a competitive Kaggle score of 0.119, placing me at rank 184 out of 5,000+ participants. This approach highlights the importance of data preprocessing and model selection in achieving robust predictions.
